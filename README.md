# SwitchBot Actions: A YAML-based Automation Engine

A powerful, configurable automation engine for SwitchBot BLE devices, with an optional Prometheus exporter.

`switchbot-actions` is a lightweight, standalone automation engine for your SwitchBot BLE devices. It turns a single `config.yaml` file into a powerful local controller, allowing you to react to device states, create time-based triggers, and integrate with MQTT and Prometheus. Its efficiency makes it a great fit for resource-constrained hardware, running comfortably on a Raspberry Pi 3 and even on a Raspberry Pi Zero. It's ideal for those who prefer a simple, configuration-driven approach to home automation without needing a large, all-in-one platform.

## Key Features

  - **Real-time Monitoring**: Gathers data from all nearby SwitchBot devices.
  - **Full MQTT Integration**: Use MQTT messages as triggers for automations, and publish messages as an action.
  - **Prometheus Exporter**: Exposes metrics at a configurable `/metrics` endpoint.
  - **Powerful Automation Rules**: Define complex automations with a unified `if/then` structure.
  - **Flexible Conditions**: Build rules based on device model, address, sensor values, and even signal strength (`rssi`).
  - **Highly Configurable**: Control every aspect of the application from a single configuration file.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

  - Python 3.10+
  - A Linux-based system with a Bluetooth adapter that supports BLE (e.g., a Raspberry Pi).

### 2. Installation (Recommended)

We strongly recommend installing with `pipx` to keep your system clean and avoid dependency conflicts.

```bash
# Install pipx
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Install the application
pipx install switchbot-actions
```

*(You may need to restart your terminal after the `pipx ensurepath` step for the changes to take effect.)*

## Running as a Systemd Service

For continuous, 24/7 monitoring, running this application as a background service is the ideal setup.

#### Step 1: Create a Dedicated Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a directory and a virtual environment for the application
sudo mkdir -p /opt/switchbot-actions
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/switchbot-actions
```

#### Step 2: Install the Application into the venv

```bash
# Use the pip from the new environment to install the package
sudo /opt/switchbot-actions/bin/pip install switchbot-actions
```

#### Step 3: Place the Configuration File

```bash
# Create a dedicated directory for the config file
sudo mkdir -p /etc/switchbot-actions

# Download the example config to the new location
sudo curl -o /etc/switchbot-actions/config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hnw/switchbot-actions/main/config.yaml.example

# Edit the configuration for your needs
sudo nano /etc/switchbot-actions/config.yaml
```

#### Step 4: Create the systemd Service File

Create a new file at `/etc/systemd/system/switchbot-actions.service` and paste the following content. Using `DynamicUser=yes` is a modern, secure way to run services without pre-existing users.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=SwitchBot Actions Daemon
After=network.target bluetooth.service

[Service]
# Run the service as its own minimal-privilege, dynamically-created user
DynamicUser=yes

# Use the absolute path to the executable and config file
ExecStart=/opt/switchbot-actions/bin/switchbot-actions -c /etc/switchbot-actions/config.yaml

Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Step 5: Enable and Start the Service

```bash
# Reload systemd to recognize the new service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable the service to start automatically on boot
sudo systemctl enable switchbot-actions.service

# Start the service immediately
sudo systemctl start switchbot-actions.service

# Check the status to ensure it's running correctly
sudo systemctl status switchbot-actions.service
```

> [\!NOTE]
> **Reloading Configuration without Downtime**
> After modifying `/etc/switchbot-actions/config.yaml`, you can apply the changes without restarting the service by sending a `SIGHUP` signal.
>
> ```bash
> sudo kill -HUP $(systemctl show --value --property MainPID switchbot-actions.service)
> ```

## Usage

We recommend a two-step process to get started smoothly.

### Step 1: Verify Hardware and Device Discovery

First, run the application in debug mode to confirm that your Bluetooth adapter is working and can discover your SwitchBot devices.

```bash
switchbot-actions --debug
```

If you see log lines containing "Received advertisement from...", your hardware setup is correct.

> [\!IMPORTANT]
> **A Note on Permissions on Linux**
> If you encounter errors related to "permission denied," you may need to run the command with `sudo`.

### Step 2: Configure and Run

Once discovery is confirmed, create your `config.yaml` file. You can download the example file as a starting point.

```bash
curl -o config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hnw/switchbot-actions/main/config.yaml.example
```

Edit `config.yaml` to define your automations, then run the application with your configuration.

```bash
switchbot-actions -c config.yaml
```

## Configuration

The application is controlled by `config.yaml`.

### Quick Start Example

To get started quickly, copy and paste the following into your `config.yaml`. This automation will log a message whenever a SwitchBot Meter's temperature rises above 28.0℃.

```yaml
automations:
  - name: "High Temperature Alert"
    if:
      source: "switchbot"
      conditions:
        modelName: "WoSensorTH"
        temperature: "> 28.0"
    then:
      type: "shell_command"
      # We redirect to stderr (>&2) so the application logs the output
      # as an ERROR, making it visible by default without needing to
      # enable DEBUG level logging.
      command: "echo 'High temperature detected: {temperature}℃' >&2"
```

### Detailed Reference & More Examples

For a complete reference of all configuration options--including advanced automations, time-based triggers, MQTT settings, the Prometheus exporter, and logging--please see the [**Project Specification**](https://github.com/hnw/switchbot-actions/blob/main/docs/specification.md).

### Command-Line Options

Command-line options provide a convenient way to override settings in your `config.yaml` for testing or temporary changes.

  - `--config <path>` or `-c <path>`: Path to the configuration file (default: `config.yaml`).
  - `--debug` or `-d`: Enables `DEBUG` level logging.
  - `--scan-cycle <seconds>`: Overrides the scan cycle time.
  - `--scan-duration <seconds>`: Overrides the scan duration time.
  - **Boolean Flags**: For any boolean flag like `--prometheus-exporter-enabled`, a corresponding `--no-` version is available to explicitly disable the feature, overriding any `true` setting in the configuration file.
  - And many more for MQTT, Prometheus, etc. Run `switchbot-actions --help` for a full list.

**Configuration Precedence**: Settings are applied in the following order of priority (later items override earlier ones):
1.  Application defaults.
2.  `config.yaml` settings.
3.  Command-line flags.

## Robustness Features

`switchbot-actions` is designed with reliability in mind, ensuring stable operation even in the face of certain issues.

  - **Fail-Fast Startup**: The application performs critical resource checks at startup. If a required resource (e.g., the configured Prometheus port) is unavailable, the application will fail immediately with a clear error message. This prevents silent failures and ensures that operational issues are identified and addressed promptly.
  - **Configuration Reload with Rollback**: The application supports dynamic configuration reloading by sending a `SIGHUP` signal to its process. If a new configuration contains errors or leads to a failed reload, the application will automatically attempt to roll back to the last known good configuration. This prevents service interruptions due to misconfigurations and enhances overall system stability.
